# Operating_Systems_and_Concorrency
Two projects from University Operating Systems Class

Sofs18 is a new File System in which we had to implement the content of all methods
(structure (methods signature) was given).

Barber Shop is a solution to a complex version of the classic concurrency problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem, with multiple barbers, clients,
chairs and tools. We had to implement the concurrent logic (most structure (method
signatures) was given).
